# Week 1 — The Beginning of Inquiry

## What This Week Is About
Week 1 is about beginnings — asking what it means to learn, how stories shape us, why math is a language, how science observes the world, and how creativity maps the mind. You’re starting your archive not with answers, but with questions: What is education? What is story? What is pattern? What is nature? What is creativity?
