# LBS 220 – Scientific Method & Experimental Design

## What This Course Is About
Design honest experiments, measure well, and reason with uncertainty. Practice the habits of reproducible research.

## Why It Matters
Sound methods prevent false confidence. Good measurement and open practices improve trust and progress.

## Course Goals
By the end of this course, you will be able to:
- Frame hypotheses and variables; design controlled studies
- Measure with units, uncertainty, and error in mind
- Collect, visualize, and reason about data
- Document and share methods for replication
