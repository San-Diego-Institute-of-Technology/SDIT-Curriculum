# Cybersecurity & Information Warfare

## What This Course Is About
Hands‑on security foundations plus analysis of information operations. Learn threat modeling, hardening, detection, and the human domain of conflict.

⸻

## Why It Matters
Most failures are preventable. Basic discipline and awareness dramatically reduce risk to people, products, and institutions.

⸻

## Course Goals
By the end of this course, you will be able to:
- Build threat models for systems and teams
- Apply baseline controls (auth, patching, backups, logging)
- Detect common attacks; respond and recover
- Analyze narratives, influence tactics, and counter‑measures
- Write clear incident and risk briefs

⸻

## Deliverables
- Two security labs (hardening + detection)
- Incident brief from a tabletop exercise
- Info‑ops case analysis

## Equipment / Tools
- VM or lab environment; logging/monitoring stack (lightweight)

⸻

## Key Practices
- Default‑deny mindset; minimize attack surface
- Verify controls; test incident plans
- Distinguish signal from noise in information environments

## Policies
- Legal, ethical participation in labs; no unauthorized testing
