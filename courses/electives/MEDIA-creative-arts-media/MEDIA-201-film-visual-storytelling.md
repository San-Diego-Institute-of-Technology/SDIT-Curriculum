# Film & Visual Storytelling

## What This Course Is About
Make short films that communicate clearly. Learn framing, light, sound, and editing as tools that serve story—not the other way around.

⸻

## Why It Matters
Visual literacy is a core skill. Crafting clear, honest film helps you document work, teach ideas, and move audiences.

## Course Goals

- Plan a shoot with a simple script, shot list, and schedule
- Capture clean audio and consistent exposure on set
- Edit for clarity and rhythm; add titles, captions, and music legally
- Run a small‑crew workflow with backups and versioning
- Critique work constructively and revise based on feedback

⸻
