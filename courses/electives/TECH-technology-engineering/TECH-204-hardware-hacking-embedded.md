# Hardware Hacking & Embedded Systems

## What This Course Is About
Hands‑on embedded development. Learn electronics basics, microcontrollers, sensor interfaces, and robust debugging to ship working prototypes.

⸻

## Why It Matters
Physical systems power the real world. Comfort with hardware unlocks new products and deepens engineering intuition.

⸻

## Course Goals
By the end of this course, you will be able to:
- Read schematics; prototype safely on breadboards/PCBs
- Configure clocks, timers, and peripherals; handle interrupts
- Interface sensors/actuators; log and visualize data
- Debug systematically; document and package projects

⸻

## Deliverables
- 4+ labs (blinky → sensors → actuator control → mini‑project)
- Demo video and write‑up per lab
- Final embedded mini‑project

## Equipment / Tools
- Microcontroller dev kit; breadboard; basic components
- Power supply, DMM, optional scope/logic analyzer
- Tooling: compiler, debugger, serial console

## 15‑Day Progression

Day 2 — Digital I/O and Debounce  
Day 3 — Timers and PWM  
Day 4 — UART and Logging  
Day 5 — I2C/SPI; Sensor Integration  
Day 6 — ADC and Signal Basics  
Day 7 — Interrupts and Low‑Power Modes  
Day 8 — Motor/Actuator Control  
Day 9 — State Machines and Robustness  
Day 10 — PCB Intro; From Breadboard to Board  
Day 11 — Packaging and Enclosures  
Day 12 — Testing and Fault Injection  
Day 13 — Mini‑project Build  
Day 14 — Debug and Polish  
Day 15 — Demo Day and Reflection  

⸻

## Key Practices
- Measure twice; power last; ESD discipline
- Version hardware and firmware; keep change logs
- Start simple; iterate in small, testable steps

## Policies
- Follow lab safety; no unattended energized setups
