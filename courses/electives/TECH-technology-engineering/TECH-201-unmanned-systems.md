# Unmanned Systems — UAS Fundamentals

## What This Course Is About
This is a hands‑on introduction to unmanned aircraft systems (UAS). You’ll assemble, configure, and operate a small, modular platform while learning core systems: airframes, propulsion, power, avionics, radio links, and flight control. Emphasis on safety, spectrum awareness, methodical troubleshooting, and clear documentation.

⸻

## Why It Matters
Safe, competent UAS work blends engineering judgment with disciplined operations. Understanding systems, spectrum, and procedures lets you build reliable platforms, fly responsibly, gather useful data, and communicate results that others can trust.

⸻

## Course Goals
By the end of this course, you will be able to:
- Build and configure a modular UAS (airframe, power, avionics)
- Plan and conduct safe flight operations with sound checklists
- Explain radio links and spectrum basics; verify failsafe behavior
- Calibrate sensors and log telemetry; analyze basic flight data
- Communicate results via concise flight logs and short post‑flight reports

⸻

## Deliverables
- Flight readiness checklist and safety briefing (team)
- Build documentation with photos/diagrams and wiring notes
- Flight logbook with 5+ entries and post‑flight analyses
- Mini‑project: plan and execute a short mission; present findings

## Equipment
- 5" class quad or similar trainer; radio transmitter; batteries and charger
- Flight controller + GPS; receiver; basic tools (soldering iron, drivers)
- Laptop with ground control software; optional simulator

⸻

## Key Practices
- Bench → Field → Debrief cycle each session
- Use checklists and SOPs; verify failsafe and return‑to‑home
- Keep detailed build notes, wiring diagrams, and configuration backups
- Maintain a consistent flight log; annotate issues and fixes
- Practice spectrum hygiene; respect local rules and safe flight areas

## Policies
- Safety first: no flight without completed checklists and a designated safety lead
- Respect spectrum and local rules; no unauthorized RF transmissions
- Fly only in approved areas; no indoor flight unless explicitly permitted
