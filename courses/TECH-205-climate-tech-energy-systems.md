# Climate Tech & Energy Systems

## What This Course Is About
Systems view of energy and climate solutions. Learn the numbers that matter, model simple scenarios, and assess technologies honestly.

⸻

## Why It Matters
Climate choices hinge on scale, timing, and cost. Clear models cut through hype and align work with real impact.

⸻

## Course Goals
By the end of this course, you will be able to:
- Model energy supply/demand and emissions at a basic level
- Compare technologies (storage, generation, efficiency, carbon removal)
- Analyze grid, policy, and market constraints
- Write decision briefs with scenarios and sensitivities

⸻

## Deliverables
- Problem sets (units, conversions, back‑of‑envelope)
- Technology brief with data and assumptions
- Final presentation with model workbook

## Equipment / Tools
- Spreadsheet or simple modeling tool; data sources

## Key Practices
- Dimensional analysis; sanity checks on all numbers
- Cite data; show assumptions and uncertainties
- Compare solutions by cost, scale, and time to impact

## Policies
- Use transparent sources; document data provenance
