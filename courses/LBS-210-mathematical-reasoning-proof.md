# LBS 210 – Mathematical Reasoning & Proof

## What This Course Is About
Build rigorous thinking through logic, sets, and proof techniques. Communicate mathematics clearly and honestly.

## Why It Matters
Proof is disciplined reasoning. It trains precision that transfers to engineering, research, and policy.

## Course Goals
By the end of this course, you will be able to:
- Use core proof techniques (direct, contradiction, contrapositive, induction)
- Work with sets, relations, functions, and graphs
- Model assumptions; separate conjecture from theorem
- Write clean, readable proofs and explanations

## Weekly Themes (15 Weeks)
1. Logic and Sets
2. Direct Proof
3. Contradiction and Contrapositive
4. Mathematical Induction
5. Functions and Relations
6. Counting and Combinatorics
7. Graphs and Connectivity
8. Probability Basics
9. Optimization Intuition
10. Algorithms and Complexity (Primer)
11. Modeling and Assumptions
12. Data and Inference (Bridges)
13. Uncertainty and Risk
14. Mathematical Communication
15. Final Problem Write‑up

## Key Practices
- State assumptions; define terms; show steps; reflect on limits
