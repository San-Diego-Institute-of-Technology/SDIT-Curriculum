# Section 04 — Forces & Balance
Course: LBS 120 – Physics with Lab

## Learning Session
Explore These Materials:
1. Read (45 min) — Newton’s Laws overview; Free‑body diagrams (short primer). Static vs kinetic friction (key ideas).  
2. Watch (60 min) — Vectors and equilibrium; Torque and levers (intro lab demos).  
3. Listen (30 min) — Everysection forces: bicycles, doors, ramps.  
4. Observe — Find a door that “feels heavy.” Where is the handle? Sketch forces and torque.

## Practice
1. Free‑Body Sketches — Draw FBDs for a book on a table, a person leaning on a wall, and a cart on an incline; label forces.  
2. Lever Lab — Use a ruler as a lever with a small weight; find balance points; relate torque τ = r × F.  
3. Friction Coefficient — Slowly increase incline for a small object until it slips; estimate μ_s = tan(θ); note uncertainties.  
4. Equilibrium Build — Stack objects into a stable tower; explain stability using center of mass and base of support.  
5. Reflection — How did diagrams alter what you noticed about forces in daily life?

## Hard Problem (Optional)
Predict the angle at which an object will begin to slide for different surfaces; test and compare to μ_s estimates. Explain discrepancies.
