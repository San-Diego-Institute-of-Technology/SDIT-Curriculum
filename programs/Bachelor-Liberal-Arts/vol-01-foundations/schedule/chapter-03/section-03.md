# Section 03 — Ratios & Proportions
Course: LBS 110 – Mathematics for Modern Thinkers

## Overview
Ratios & Proportions


## Learning Session
Explore These Materials:
1. Read (45 min) — Ratios vs. rates; scaling and similar figures (short notes). Golden ratio: myth vs math.  
2. Watch (60 min) — Visualizing proportions (mixtures, recipes, maps); Aspect ratios in design and film.  
3. Listen (30 min) — When ratios mislead (risk communication and relative vs absolute).  
4. Reflect While Engaging — Log 5 ratios you used today (time/points/dollars/km); label each as ratio or rate.

## Practice
1. Scale a Recipe — Double a recipe keeping taste/texture; explain which ratios must stay fixed.  
2. Map + Model — Build a scale diagram of your room or desk; choose a scale and justify.  
3. Speed/Time/Distance — Record a short trip; compute average speed; re‑express as min/km and mph; discuss trade‑offs of units.  
4. Proportion Puzzles — Solve 3 mixture problems; show unit analysis.  
5. Reflection — Where do ratios clarify reality vs obscure it?

## Hard Problem (Optional)
Given two rectangles with the same area but different aspect ratios, argue which better fits a given set of objects; quantify “fit” with a ratio‑based metric you design.
