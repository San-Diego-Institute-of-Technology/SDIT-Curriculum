## Practice
1. Claim + Reasons — Draft a 200‑word claim with 3 reasons; tag each as fact, value, or policy.  
2. Counterargument + Rebuttal — Steelman the best counterargument; rebut fairly.  
3. Persuasive Piece — 600–800 word essay using ethos/pathos/logos intentionally; mark where each appears.  
4. Edit for Clarity — Cut 15%; highlight improved clarity; track one fallacy you removed.  
5. Reflection — What changed when I charitably represented the opposing view?

## Hard Problem (Optional)
Choose a controversial topic; write two 150‑word arguments for opposing sides that a reasonable person from each side would endorse. Note the constraints that kept you honest.
