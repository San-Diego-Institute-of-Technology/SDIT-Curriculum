## Practice
1. Life Timeline — Sketch 10 turning points; note the question behind each.  
2. Dialogue with Self — Write a Socratic dialogue (Q&A with yourself) about a belief you hold; identify assumptions and counter‑examples.  
3. Habits of Examination — Define 3 practices you’ll use each chapter (journal prompts, conversation, nature walk, argument map).  
4. Reflection — “Is the unexamined life not worth living?” Argue for or against with examples from your timeline.

## Hard Problem (Optional)
Consider the Euthyphro dilemma (Is something good because God commands it, or does God command it because it’s good?). Identify the structure of the dilemma and how it informs your approach to moral questions.
