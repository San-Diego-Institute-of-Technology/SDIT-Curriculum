# Section 05 — Play as Learning
Course: LAB 101 – Creative Intelligence Lab I

## Learning Session (≈3 hrs)
Explore These Materials:
1. Read (45 min) — Piaget on play (short excerpt); Seymour Papert, Mindstorms (intro on learning through making).  
2. Watch (45 min) — Playful learning: MIT Media Lab projects; Game design and flow (short talk).  
3. Listen (30 min) — Jane McGonigal on games and motivation (podcast clip).  
4. Observe (60 min) — Notice how you explore when stakes are low vs high; list behaviors that signal curiosity vs fear.

## Key Quote Box
“_______________________________________________________”

## Practice (≈6 hrs)
1. Playground Prototyping (2 hrs) — Build 3 tiny prototypes that encourage exploration (paper, tape, simple materials); test each for 5 minutes.  
2. Rule Twist (1.5 hrs) — Take a familiar game; change one rule to emphasize learning a skill (memory, estimation, balance); test with a friend.  
3. Debrief Notes (1 hr) — Capture what participants did first, when they got stuck, and what made them laugh or try again.  
4. Reflection (1.5 hrs) — Define “serious play” for your own practice; where will you use it this semester?

## Hard Problem (Optional)
Design a 15‑minute classroom warm‑up that uses playful constraints to teach a core idea from one of your courses; write clear rules and success criteria.
