# Day 05 — Creative Constraints
Course: LAB 101 – Creative Intelligence Lab I

## Learning Session (≈3 hrs)
Explore These Materials:
1. Read (30 min) — On constraints in creativity (short design essays); Dr. Seuss on writing with limited vocabulary (anecdote).  
2. Watch (45 min) — Creativity under rules: examples from film, music, and design challenges.  
3. Listen (30 min) — A creator discusses how constraints shaped a project.  
4. Observe (75 min) — Pick a mundane object and list 10 novel uses within strict limits (time, tools, materials).

## Key Quote Box
“_______________________________________________________”

## Practice (≈6 hrs)
1. 10x10 Challenge (2 hrs) — Create 10 tiny artifacts in 10‑minute sprints using one constraint (e.g., only circles; only verbs; only 3 chords).  
2. Constraint Remix (1.5 hrs) — Take your favorite sprint and remake it with a different constraint; note what changes.  
3. One‑Tool Build (1.5 hrs) — Make a small piece (poem, sketch, track, diagram) using a single tool or medium only.  
4. Reflection (1 hr) — Which constraints unlocked originality vs felt limiting? What will you keep using?

## Hard Problem (Optional)
Design a 60‑second story (script or storyboard) that uses exactly 10 shots/scenes and no dialogue. Convey a clear arc with only visuals.
