# Section 04 — Motion & Measurement
Course: LBS 120 – Physics with Lab

## Overview
Motion & Measurement


## Learning Session
Explore These Materials:
1. Read (45 min) — Galileo on motion (short excerpt); Dimensional analysis & units (notes).  
2. Watch (45 min) — Average vs instantaneous speed; Measuring uncertainty (intro lab concepts).  
3. Listen (30 min) — Everysection measurement: where errors creep in.  
4. Observe — Track a moving object (bike, elevator, your own walk) and list what you can and cannot measure reliably.

## Practice
1. Straight‑Line Walk — Measure distance and time for a 50–100 m walk; compute average speed; repeat 3 times; estimate uncertainty.  
2. Ramp Trial — Roll a small object down a gentle incline; measure position vs time at equal intervals; sketch x(t) and v_avg over intervals.  
3. Instrument Notes — Document tools, calibration steps, and possible error sources (reaction time, alignment, slope).  
4. Reflection — How does careful measurement change what I believe vs what I thought I saw?

## Hard Problem (Optional)
Estimate g (gravitational acceleration) using a phone timer and a drop test over a safe short height. Report method, data, estimate, and dominant uncertainties.
