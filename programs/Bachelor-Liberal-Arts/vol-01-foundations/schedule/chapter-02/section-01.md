# Section 01 — Logic & Reasoning
Course: LBS 101 – The Mental Gym

## Overview
Logic & Reasoning


## Learning Session
Explore These Materials:
1. Read (45 min) — Aristotle, Organon (Categories & Prior Analytics, short excerpts); Lewis Carroll, “What the Tortoise Said to Achilles”.  
2. Watch (60 min) — Intro to Logic: Validity vs. Soundness (short lecture); Argument Mapping basics (workshop clip).  
3. Listen (30 min) — Philosophy Bites: What Is a Good Argument? (episode).  
4. Reflect While Engaging — Note examples of valid-but-unsound vs sound arguments; list 5 common fallacies you notice in daily life.

## Key Quote Box
Write one quote from today’s materials that you want to keep:  
“_______________________________________________________”

## Practice
1. Syllogism Lab — Write 3 syllogisms: one valid & sound, one valid but unsound, one invalid; explain each.  
2. Fallacy Hunt — Collect 5 real‑world statements (ads, posts, conversations) and identify the fallacy and why it persuades.  
3. Argument Map — Map a short editorial’s main claim, reasons, evidence, and counterarguments.  
4. Reflection — What habits help me reason better? Where am I most prone to bias?

## Hard Problem (Optional)
Analyze the Liar Paradox (“This statement is false.”) or Russell’s Barber Paradox. What does it reveal about the limits of formal systems vs. natural language?
