# Section 03 — Patterns & Sequences
Course: LBS 110 – Mathematics for Modern Thinkers

## Learning Session (≈3 hrs)
Explore These Materials:
1. Read (45 min) — Intro to sequences: arithmetic vs geometric; Fibonacci and the idea of recurrence (short notes).  
2. Watch (60 min) — Visual Patterns in Nature (morphogenesis); Numberphile‑style segment on famous integer sequences.  
3. Listen (30 min) — A short piece on pattern recognition and perception.  
4. Reflect While Engaging (45 min) — Log where you see repeating structure today (music, architecture, calendars, code, exercise sets).

## Practice (≈6 hrs)
1. Daily Sequence (1 hr) — Record an activity as an arithmetic sequence (e.g., steps, reps, minutes). Graph it.  
2. Growth Patterns (1.5 hrs) — Model a simple geometric growth (e.g., savings with constant percentage); explain parameters.  
3. Recurrence Sketch (1.5 hrs) — Define a recurrence for a simple process (e.g., cooling coffee, stairs workout) and compute first 10 terms.  
4. Pattern Hunt (1 hr) — Photograph or sketch 3 natural or human‑made patterns; annotate the rule you suspect.  
5. Reflection (1 hr) — What’s the difference between a pattern I impose vs one I discover?

## Hard Problem (Optional)
Given a recurrence aₙ = 2·aₙ₋₁ + 1 with a₀ = 0, find a closed form for aₙ and justify it informally.
