# Section 01 — Truth & Perspectives
Course: LBS 101 – The Mental Gym

## Learning Session
Explore These Materials:
1. Read (45 min) — Plato, Allegory of the Cave (Republic, Book VII, excerpts); Nietzsche, On Truth and Lies in a Nonmoral Sense (excerpt).  
2. Watch (45 min) — Allegory of the Cave explained (short lecture); Relativism vs Realism (overview).  
3. Listen (30 min) — Philosophy Bites: Truth and Relativism (podcast segment).  
4. Reflect While Engaging — As you read/watch/listen, list claims that changed when the perspective shifted (author, culture, method).

## Key Quote Box
Write one quote from today’s materials that you want to keep:  
“_______________________________________________________”

## Practice
1. Perspective Grid — Pick a contemporary question (e.g., AI risk, nutrition, justice). Write the central claim from three perspectives (scientific, philosophical, personal). Note what counts as evidence for each.  
2. Cave, Recast — Rewrite Plato’s cave in a modern setting (news feeds, algorithms, subcultures). Who are the prisoners, shadows, fire, and sun?  
3. Claim/Evidence/Ambiguity — Take one strong claim you hold. List the best evidence for and against it, plus what you don’t know yet.  
4. Reflection — When does “it depends” (relativism) help us think better, and when does it excuse sloppy reasoning?

## Hard Problem (Optional)
Choose one theory of truth (correspondence, coherence, or pragmatic). Defend it with a concrete case study, and explain how the other two theories would handle the same case.
