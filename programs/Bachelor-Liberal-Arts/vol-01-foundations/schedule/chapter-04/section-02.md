# Section 02 — Structure & Flow
Course: LBS 105 – Writing & Communication I

## Overview
Structure & Flow


## Learning Session
Explore These Materials:
1. Read (45 min) — Zinsser, On Writing Well (chapters on structure); The Pyramid Principle (short excerpt).  
2. Watch (45 min) — Organizing Arguments: Openings, Signposts, and Transitions (workshop clip).  
3. Listen (30 min) — Non‑Linear to Linear: Outlining from Notes (craft conversation).  
4. Reflect While Engaging — Reverse‑outline a favorite essay: write the claim for each paragraph and circle the transitions.

## Practice
1. Reverse Outline — Take a 600–800 word piece you’ve written. Create a one‑line claim for each paragraph, reorder for the strongest flow, and produce a new version.  
2. Signpost Pass — Add topic sentences, transitions, and “because/therefore” links. Highlight where flow improved.  
3. Visual Map — Draw a flow diagram of your argument (claims, reasons, evidence, counter). Use arrows and labels to show movement.  
4. Reflection — Where does pacing (sentence/paragraph length) increase clarity or energy?

## Hard Problem (Optional)
Write a 300‑word argument with perfect local clarity (each sentence makes sense) that nevertheless fails globally (the whole doesn’t persuade). Annotate why local clarity is not enough.
