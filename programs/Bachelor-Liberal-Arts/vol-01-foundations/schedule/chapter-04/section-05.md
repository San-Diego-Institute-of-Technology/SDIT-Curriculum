# Section 05 — Storytelling Through Images
Course: LAB 101 – Creative Intelligence Lab I

## Learning Session
Explore These Materials:
1. Read (45 min) — Scott McCloud, Understanding Comics (excerpts on sequence and closure); Short guide to shot composition.  
2. Watch (45 min) — Every Frame a Painting: Visual comedy timing; Pixar: Visual storytelling basics.  
3. Listen (30 min) — Cinematography podcast on framing and movement.  
4. Observe — Collect 10 frames (photos/screenshots) whose composition communicates emotion or idea without words; annotate why.

## Key Quote Box
“_______________________________________________________”

## Practice
1. Six‑Shot Story — Create a 6‑frame story (no words). Ensure a clear beginning, middle, and end.  
2. Photo Essay — Document a simple process (making tea, mending, sketching) in 8–10 images; vary shot scale (wide/medium/close).  
3. Scene Anatomy — Choose a short film scene; mark beats and what each shot changes (information, emotion, tension).  
4. Reflection — What can images carry that words struggle to? Where did you rely on captions instead of composition?

## Hard Problem (Optional)
Storyboard an abstract idea (freedom, balance, truth) in 8 panels using only objects and light; no faces or text. Convey the concept through composition and contrast.
