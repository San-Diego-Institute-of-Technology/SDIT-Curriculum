# Section 04 — Energy & Work
Course: LBS 120 – Physics with Lab

## Overview
Energy & Work


## Learning Session
Explore These Materials:
1. Read (45 min) — Work‑Energy theorem; Potential energy (gravitational and spring) — short primer.  
2. Watch (45 min) — Energy Skate Park (simulation overview); From forces to energy (lab demo).  
3. Listen (30 min) — Energy vs Power in everyday devices (short segment).  
4. Observe — Identify three daily activities and list the energy transformations (chemical → mechanical → thermal, etc.).

## Key Quote Box

## Practice
1. Stair Climb — Estimate your work against gravity: measure mass, floors climbed, and compute mgh; discuss sources of error.  
2. Spring Test — Measure a spring constant k (weights and ruler); estimate energy 1/2 kx^2 at two extensions; compare to “feel.”  
3. Energy Accounting — Choose a system (pendulum, rolling ball). Describe energy transfers/losses (sound, heat, deformation) through a cycle.  
4. Reflection — Distinguish energy (capacity to do work) from power (rate). Where did you mistake one for the other this week?

## Hard Problem (Optional)
Two people carry the same load up the same height; one slowly, one quickly. Who does more work? Who expends more power? Where could total energy differ in practice?
