# Section 01 — What is a Liberal Education?
**Course:** LBS 101 – The Mental Gym

---

## Session Overview

This first session is your introduction to the soul of SDIT.

You’re not here to memorize facts. You’re here to explore meaning — through reading, conversation, philosophy, reflection, and creative expression. Today’s work is about tuning your internal compass. What is education? What is it for? What kind of learner — and person — do you want to become?

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this session, you will:

- Write a personal definition of "education"
- Compare classical and modern critiques of the university
- Visually map your worldview and how education fits into it
- Reflect on who you're becoming through this process

---

## Practice Blocks

### Define Education  
Write your own definition of “education.” Not what school told you — what *you* believe it is. Be honest. Be clear. Use your own language.

---

### Compare Perspectives  
Write a reflection comparing your definition to those of:
- John Henry Newman
- Harry Lewis

Structure your reflection around three ideas:
- Where I Agree
- Where I Diverge
- What I Carry Forward

---

### Visual Mind Map  
Draw a visual map of your current worldview. Include:
- What matters most to you in life
- How you see the world
- Where education fits in
Use drawings, arrows, symbols, or clusters. No need to be neat — be expressive.

---

### Reflection  
Journal in response to the following prompts:
- Why do I want an education?
- Who do I hope to become by the end of this program?
- What kind of life do I want to build — and how does learning fit in?

---

## Hard Problem (Optional)

**Design Your Ideal University**  
- List 10 courses or experiences that every student would take.  
- What would you remove from traditional models?  
- Write a 1–2 page manifesto describing your university’s purpose, structure, and soul.

---

## Notes

- This session can be done as fast or slow as needed, no need to rush it. 
- It’s okay to struggle with these ideas. Wrestling with them is part of the work.  
- The goal is not to finish quickly — it’s to approah *truthfully*.
