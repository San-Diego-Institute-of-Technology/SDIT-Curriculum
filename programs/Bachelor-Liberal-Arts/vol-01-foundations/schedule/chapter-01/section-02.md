# Section 02 — The Power of Story  
**Course:** LBS 105 – Writing & Communication I: Rhetoric & Storytelling

---

## Session Overview

Stories are at the heart of how we think, feel, and connect. In this session, you’ll explore the mechanics of persuasion and narrative—from classic rhetorical foundations to modern storytelling—so that you can both analyze and craft stories with intention.

You’ll read theory, watch inspiring visuals, listen to real storytellers, write your own narrative, and reflect deeply on the meaning and power of storytelling in your life.

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this session, you will:

- Recognize rhetorical and storytelling techniques in classic and modern sources
- Analyze what makes stories persuasive, memorable, and authentic
- Write and revise your own story with awareness of style and technique
- Reflect on the role of storytelling in shaping your voice and purpose

---

## Session Flow

### 1. Set Intention  

Begin by recalling why storytelling matters to you. Maybe share a memorable story you heard or wrote, aloud or with a friend. Center yourself in the power of narrative.

---

### 2. Read

  [Read the excerpt online](https://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/rhetoric.1.i.html) (navigate to relevant section)

- **Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, “The Danger of a Single Story”** (essay)  
  [Read the essay at The New Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2009/10/12/the-danger-of-a-single-story)

---

### 3. Watch  

- **Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie — _The Danger of a Single Story_** (TED Talk, ~18 min)  
  [Watch on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9Ihs241zeg)

### 4. Listen  

**The Moth storytelling podcast** — one episode (~20–30 min)  
[Choose a memorable episode](https://themoth.org/podcast) and listen attentively to how the storyteller builds tension, voice, and emotional impact.

---

### 5. Reflect While Engaging  

Take notes as you read, watch, and listen:
- What rhetorical moves stand out?
- Which narrative elements (voice, detail, pacing) stick with you?
- Sketch images, quote phrases, ask questions in your margin or notebook.

## Practice Blocks

### Analyze a Story  
Pick one story you encountered—Aristotle’s write-up, Adichie’s essay, or The Moth episode.  
List **three techniques** that made it compelling—think of pacing, imagery, emotional build, rhetorical devices, or speaker voice.

---

### Write Your Own Story  
Create a **two-page narrative**, real or imagined, using at least one rhetorical or storytelling technique (e.g., contrast, repetition, vivid detail, strong opening, personal voice).

---

### Peer Reflection (Optional)  
Read your story aloud to someone else (or record yourself).  
Note moments that felt powerful or flat. Ask:
- What phrase struck you?
- Where did your attention drift?
- What clarified, and what confused?

---

### Creative Rewrite  
Take the story you just wrote and **rewrite it in a different style or voice**—for example:
- Shift from formal to conversational
- Change tone (humorous → serious, introspective → dramatic)

Reflect on what shifted in mood, clarity, or tension.

---

### Reflection  
Write a short reflection (a few paragraphs) responding to these prompts:
- What does storytelling mean to me?
- How might storytelling shape my thinking, learning, or future work?

---

## Hard Problem (Optional) 

Pick your two-page story and **rewrite it twice**:
1. As a **political speech**—incorporate rhetoric, repetition, calls to action.
2. As a **children’s bedtime story**—simple language, warmth, and soothing tone.

What changes in structure, tone, vocabulary, and emotional impact? Why?

## Notes

- Having trouble understanding a concept? Use the "Knowledge Expert" to help explain the concepts better.
- If you feel stuck, talk through your emerging story with someone, or record yourself telling it.
- The goal isn’t polished—it's to discover your narrative voice. Start messy, stay honest.
