# Semester Overview
This first volume is about foundations: learning how to think clearly, communicate with purpose, see the world mathematically and scientifically, and explore creativity as a daily practice.

Across five courses, you will move between philosophy, writing, math, science, and creative exploration. The goal is not just to cover content, but to begin building the habits of a reflective learner — someone who can connect ideas across fields, ask better questions, and carry wisdom forward into life.

By the end of this semester, you will:
- Understand what a liberal education is and why it matters.
- Strengthen your ability to write, tell stories, and persuade.
- Explore mathematics not as memorization, but as a language of patterns.
- Learn how to observe the natural world through experiments and curiosity.
- Develop your creative intelligence through projects, sketches, and artifacts.
