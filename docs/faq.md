# FAQ
**What is SDIT?**  
A nonprofit educational and research institute blending technology, arts, and liberal education.

**What is DEUS?**  
Defense Engineering & Unmanned Systems — practical work in UAS, spectrum analysis, RF systems, and electronic warfare awareness.

**What is MIRA?**  
Mullen Institute of Radical Arts — films, surf/skate, music, and design projects that connect culture and engineering.

**What programs are offered?**  
- Liberal Education 2.0 (interdisciplinary core)  
- Engineering tracks (e.g., drones/UAS, spectrum, AI systems)  
- Labs & Studios (e.g., Mental Models Lab, Creative Intelligence)

**What research projects are active?**  
Examples include a Spectrum Analysis Toolkit, a UAS Engineering Platform, and applied engineering projects across sensing, communications, power, and mechanisms. MIRA leads short films, surf/skate design experiments, and a music/sound lab.

**How are students assessed?**  
Journals, portfolios, and shipped projects rather than grades.

**What is “$49 Education”?**  
A principle: radically affordable, high-quality learning materials and guidance. We publish open resources and focus on hands-on, project-based learning.

**Are you accredited?**  
Early-stage and exploring the WSCUC path. The current phase emphasizes credibility via research output, public work, and community impact.

**How do I apply or get involved?**  
Start by following our public materials and projects. Prospective students and collaborators can reach out with a short portfolio and a project idea they want to ship.

**Where can I find the curriculum?**  
Core outlines and syllabi are being developed openly. See the knowledge base and docs for updates as courses are published.

**What’s your philosophy of education?**  
Independent thought, craft, and service. Interdisciplinary “tree-of-knowledge” learning, daily practice (Mental Gym), and validation by shipped work.

**Do you publish research?**  
Yes. We aim for public artifacts: papers, code, datasets, films, and engineering prototypes whenever permissible.

**How can I contribute?**  
Open issues and PRs are welcome on documentation and non-sensitive materials. For research collaborations, share your domain expertise and prior work.
