  <h1 id="faq">FAQ</h1>
<p><strong>What is SDIT?</strong><br />
A nonprofit educational and research institute blending technology, arts, and liberal education.</p>
<p><strong>What is DEUS?</strong><br />
Defense Engineering &amp; Unmanned Systems — practical work in UAS, spectrum analysis, RF systems, and electronic warfare awareness.</p>
<p><strong>What is MIRA?</strong><br />
Mullen Institute of Radical Arts — films, surf/skate, music, and design projects that connect culture and engineering.</p>
<p><strong>What programs are offered?</strong><br />
- Liberal Education 2.0 (interdisciplinary core)<br />
- Engineering tracks (e.g., drones/UAS, spectrum, AI systems)<br />
- Labs &amp; Studios (e.g., Mental Models Lab, Creative Intelligence)</p>
<p><strong>What research projects are active?</strong><br />
Examples include a Spectrum Analysis Toolkit, a UAS Engineering Platform, and applied engineering projects across sensing, communications, power, and mechanisms. MIRA leads short films, surf/skate design experiments, and a music/sound lab.</p>
<p><strong>How are students assessed?</strong><br />
Journals, portfolios, and shipped projects rather than grades.</p>
<p><strong>What is “$49 Education”?</strong><br />
A principle: radically affordable, high-quality learning materials and guidance. We publish open resources and focus on hands-on, project-based learning.</p>
<p><strong>Are you accredited?</strong><br />
Early-stage and exploring the WSCUC path. The current phase emphasizes credibility via research output, public work, and community impact.</p>
<p><strong>How do I apply or get involved?</strong><br />
Start by following our public materials and projects. Prospective students and collaborators can reach out with a short portfolio and a project idea they want to ship.</p>
<p><strong>Where can I find the curriculum?</strong><br />
Core outlines and syllabi are being developed openly. See the knowledge base and docs for updates as courses are published.</p>
<p><strong>What’s your philosophy of education?</strong><br />
Independent thought, craft, and service. Interdisciplinary “tree-of-knowledge” learning, daily practice (Mental Gym), and validation by shipped work.</p>
<p><strong>Do you publish research?</strong><br />
Yes. We aim for public artifacts: papers, code, datasets, films, and engineering prototypes whenever permissible.</p>
<p><strong>How can I contribute?</strong><br />
Open issues and PRs are welcome on documentation and non-sensitive materials. For research collaborations, share your domain expertise and prior work.</p>
